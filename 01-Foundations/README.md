# Module 1: Thinking Before You Code - The Foundations of Logic

Welcome to your first step into the world of programming! In this module, we won't just be writing code; we'll be learning *how to think* in a way a computer can understand. The goal is to bridge the gap between a human idea and a computer instruction.

### Part 1: What is Programming?
Think of it like writing a recipe. If you want a friend to bake a cake exactly like yours, you can't just say, "Bake a cake." You have to provide a list of precise, step-by-step instructions: what ingredients to use, in what amounts, and in what order to combine them.
Computers are like a chef who is incredibly fast and powerful but takes everything you say literally. They can't guess what you mean. Your instructions—your "code"—must be perfect.

### Part 2: Thinking Like a Programmer: Decomposition
Before you can write instructions, you need to master the most important skill in programming: **decomposition**. This simply means breaking down a large, complex problem into a series of smaller, manageable sub-problems.
Let's try a non-code example. How would you instruct a robot to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
You might start with "Put peanut butter on bread." But that's too vague! You have to break it down:
1. Pick up a slice of bread from the bag
2. Place the bread on a plate
3. Pick up the peanut butter jar
4. Unscrew the lid
5. Pick up a knife
6. Dip the knife into the jar
7. ...and so on

This is how programmers think. We take a big goal ("build a website") and decompose it into hundreds or thousands of tiny, precise steps that a computer can execute.

### Part 3: Your First Conversation with a Computer

To give our instructions, we need a language. We will be using **Python**, a language famous for its readability and beginner-friendliness.

The most basic instruction we can give is to tell the computer to display something on the screen. For this, we use the `print()` command.

Let's look at the most famous first program ever written:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This single line of code might look simple, but it contains three key parts:
1. ```print```: This is the function, or the command name. It's a verb that tells the computer to perform an action: "display on screen"
2. ```()```: The parentheses are used to hold the information (the **data**) that the function will use
3. ```"Hello, World!"```: This is the data itself. In programming, text is called a **string**, and we have to wrap it in quotes to tell Python that it's text
When the computer runs this line, it will execute the ```print``` command using the data ```"Hello, World!"``` and display that exact text on your screen.
